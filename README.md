# Project Youtube Euphoria

See a youtube video that might provide some interesting insights, but not enough time and brain power to sit through the video and process it's contents?

That's where Youtube Euphoria comes into play! Get your dose of dopamin regardless of time and day! A click of a button, Youtube Euphoria coming your way!

Simply input the url of the youtube video of interest.

A card with a link to the video and summary of it's content will be created.

These cards will be organised and stored in one place.

## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Target Audience:

-   Anyone who watches youtube for knowledge

### Audience pain points:

-   Have to make the effort to make notes
-   Have to sit through the entire video to get the gist of the content
-   Might have to re-watch the video a few times to digest videos with more complex content

### Project Value Proposition

-   Organises and stores summarised version of video into cards

### List of User Stories:

-   As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

###Bugs:

-   The edit button only works if you click on the edit button in the first video card. Afterwhich the edit button will work for the rest of the videos.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
